    "### Example 4.2 : Jack's Car Rental. \n",
    "Jack manages two locations for a nationwide car rental company. Each day, some number of customers arrive at each location to rent cars. If Jack has a car available, he rents it out and is credited \\\\$10 by the national company. If he is out of cars at the location, then the business is lost. Cars become available for renting the day after they are returned. To help ensure that cars are available where they are needed, Jack can move them between two locations overnight, at a cost of \\\\$2 per car moved. We assume that the number of cars requested and returned at each location are Poisson random variables, meaning that the probability that the number is $n$ is $\\frac{\\lambda^n}{n!}e^{-\\lambda}$"
