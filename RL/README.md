# Dynamic Programming in Reinforcement Learning  
The term dynamic programming(DP) refers to a collection of algorithms that can be used to compute optimal policies given a perfect model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process(MDP) (Sutton & Barto, 2018).

****
The key idea of DP, and of reinforcement learning generally, is the use of value functions to organize and structure the search for good policies.
