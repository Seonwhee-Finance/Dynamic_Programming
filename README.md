# Dynamic Programming
Introducing dynamic programming with several well-known problems  

### 1. Introduction  
Dynamic programming(DP) is one of the algorithms which break a problem into smaller subproblems and use the solutions of the subproblems to construct the solution of the larger one. The number of subproblems may become considerably large, and there are cases to solve the same subploblem repeatedly, needlessly increasing the running time. DP organizes computations to avoid recomputing values that you already know, which can often save a great deal of time.
